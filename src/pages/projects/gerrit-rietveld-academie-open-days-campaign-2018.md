For the annual Rietveld Academie's Open Days campaign, we imagined, directed
  and produced a video campaign in three episodes reflecting the ideas of
  team-spirit, playfulness and challenge, which strongly determine the studies
  at the Academie. The video was shot within the walls of the school, with the
  technical assistance of the audiovisual department (VAV) and amateurs student
  football players as actors. The whole campaign only featured 'Rietveld-made'
  typefaces as well. The videos were released one after the other during the
  three weeks prior to the event. The signage, designed as a physical extension
  of the video, accompanied visitors through the buildings on the day of the
  event.
