title: Kumusta kabayan?
description: >-
  _Kumusta kabayan?_ is a self-published magazine collaboratively designed with
  fellow kabayans (compatriot in Tagalog) of Amsterdam, within a community, over
  seas. It is an editorial surface which assemble dormant skills, traditional
  knowledges and identifiable aesthetics of the Overseas Filipino Worker's
  community members met in the Netherlands. It is mostly an exchange with
  impromptus calligraphers, illustrators, translators or interprets,
  story-tellers. 


  The first issue was one representation of these signs we display, an ongoing
  pilgrimage around the necessary fragments to replicate some semblance of the
  homeland.
