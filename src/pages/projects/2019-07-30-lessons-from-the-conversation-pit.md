Informative booklet intended for students studying with dissabilty or chronic ilness at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie. We wanted to design a publication that is functional and that deals with legibility. To deliver the content, we tried to find a typeface that would impose difficulty on reading. The display typeface OS Mimic we chose, was designed by Wooseok Jang and draws inspiration from emoticons and facial expressions.
